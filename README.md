# Python-Challenge

Inside the Challenge 3 folder, you will find subfolders called PyBank and Pypoll that contains the Python files needed for the challenge. 
Within these folders also contain another subfolder called Analysis which will house the generated .txt file when the programs are ran. 

The Pybank challenge is a financial calculator that draws certain information from the given data set, in this case, the total number of months of data available, the net total amount of profit/loss over the entire period, the changes and average of the profit/loss, and greatest increase/decrease over the entire period.

The Pypoll challenge is a simpler election results calculator that draws the winning election candidate, total votes casted, total votes per candidate with percentages, and the election winner.
